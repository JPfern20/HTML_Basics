    <h2>A Tasty Treat</h2>
    <h3>Creamy Coffee Jelly</h3>
    
    <p>Cubes of jelly, flavored with coffee served in a thick, sweetened cream, this coffee jelly is definitely a crowd-pleaser and an excellent dessert for any occasion.</p>
    

    
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1 pouch clear jelly powder (gulaman/agar agar) - (25g) see Note 1 for gelatin powder</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Water:</strong> 5 cup</li>
        <li><strong>Instant Coffee Powder:</strong> 2 - 3 Table Spoons</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar:</strong>  4 - 5 Table Spoons</li>
        <li><strong>Condensed Milk:</strong> 1 Can</li>
        <li><strong>All-Purpose Cream:</strong> 500ML</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Preparation:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><em>In a pot, add water and gradually sprinkle jelly powder, stir until dissolved.</em></li>
        <li><em>Bring to a soft boil then remove from heat. Add sugar and coffee powder and stir until completely dissolved.</em></li>
        <li><em>Pour mixture in a 9x9-inch square pan and let it cool to set.   </em></li>
        <li><em>Using a knife, cut through the coffee jelly horizontally and then vertically to make cubes. It could be big or small cubes. </em></li>
        <li><em>In a large bowl or container with lid, mix together the sweetened condensed milk and all-purpose cream until well combined. Add the coffee jelly cubes and mix again. Cover and chill.</em></li>
        <li><em>Serve it cold</em></li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Cooking Tips:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Note 1. Gelatin powder can also be used and I would recommend using Knox but you may have to adjust the amount, 1 envelope =2 cups of water, so you will need 3 envelopes.  The procedure is also different. You just dissolve the gelatin in hot water or hot coffee and refrigerate for 2 hours or until set.</li>
        <li>Note 2. I only used a small can of sweetened condensed milk (168ml) while I added 2 packs of cream (=500ml). This is a personal preference as we prefer desserts not to be overly too sweet. You can adjust this if you like it sweeter.</li>
        <li>Note 3. I added sugar to the coffee jelly, again a personal choice. You can adjust or skip it altogether if you like.</li>
    </ul>
