        Talk to me, talk to me
        Talk to me, talk to me
        Hm
        Looks like we're making up for lost time
        Need you to spell it out for me
        Bossa Nova on all night
        It's like a type of alchemy
        Introduce me to your best friend
        I can come and slot right in
        A satellite ain't even that far
        I, I kinda wonder where you are
        Already know I can't leave it alone
        You're on my mind, mm
        Already gave you the time and the place
        So, don't be shy
        Just come be the man I need
        Tell me you got something to give, I want it
        I kinda like it when you call me wonderful
        Whatever the type of talk it is, come on then
        I gotta know you're meant to be the man I need
        Talk to me
        Talk to me
        Mm, talk to me, talk to me
        Be the man that I need, baby
        Talk to me, talk to me
        Be the man that I need, need, need
        Mm, talk to me, talk to me
        Be the man that I need, baby
        Talk to me, talk to me
        Be the man, man, man, man, man
        I'd like to think you feel the same way
        But I can't tell with you sometimes
        So, baby, let's get on the same page
        Stop making me read between the lines
        Already know I can't leave it alone
        You're on my mind, mm
        Already gave you the time and the place
        So, don't be shy
        Just come be the man I need
        Tell me you got something to give, I want it
        I kinda like it when you call me wonderful
        Whatever the type of talk it is, come on then
        I gotta know you're meant to be the man I need
        Talk to me, talk to me
        Talk to me, talk to me
        Mm, talk to me, talk to me
        Be the man that I need, baby (be the man)
        Talk to me, talk to me
        Be the man that I need, need, need
        Mm, talk to me, talk to me
        Be the man that I need, baby (be the man)
        Talk to me, talk to me
        Be the man, man, man, man, man

        Mm, mm</pre>
